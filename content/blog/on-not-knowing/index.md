Today slipped away from me, it seems, and I almost went to bed before writing. I’m feeling it. Not surprising, really. As with anything else, when you are trying to make a lifestyle change and form a new habit, the first week is always the toughest to get through.

Not knowing is uncomfortable. I hear it’s harder for some than others. As a developer who also struggles with being on the not-knowing side of things, imposter syndrome can be quite strong for me. That’s probably why I like to say to myself and others so frequently that I really don’t know what I’m doing 9 times out of 10. I must take some solace in beating that fact into my psyche as a method for slowly becoming more comfortable with it.
