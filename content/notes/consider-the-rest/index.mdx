Life is not binary. It’s best to remember this when things don’t go as we would have hoped. There are far more than two possible outcomes to any given situation, not simple a good outcome and a bad outcome. So while in our minds it may feel like we are experiencing a bad outcome, consider some of the far worse outcomes that didn’t happen and then count your blessings. This is even more important for those of us with considerable privilege in this life, and it can help us build empathy with others.

> One must never forget when misfortunes come that it is quite possible they are saving one from something much worse; or that when you make some great mistake, it may very easily serve you better than the best-advised decision. Life is a whole, and luck is a whole, and no part of them can be separated from the rest.

```js
const { a, b, ...rest } = outcomes
consider(rest)
```
